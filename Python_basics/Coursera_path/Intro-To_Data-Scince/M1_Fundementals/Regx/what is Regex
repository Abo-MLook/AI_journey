Regex
In this lecture we're going to talk about pattern matching in strings using regular expressions. Regular expressions, or regexes,
are written in a condensed formatting language. In general, you can think of a regular expression as a pattern which you give to a regex processor
with some source data. The processor then parses that source data using that pattern, and returns chunks of text back to the a data scientist or programmer
for further manipulation. There's really three main reasons you would want to do this - to check whether a pattern exists within some source data,
to get all instances of a complex pattern from some source data, or to clean your source data using a pattern generally through string splitting.
 Regexes are not trivial, !! but they are a foundational technique for data cleaning in data science applications, and a solid understanding of regexs
 will help you quickly and efficiently manipulate text data for further data science application.

Now, you could teach a whole course on regular expressions alone, especially if you wanted to demystify how the regex parsing engine
works and efficient mechanisms for parsing text. In this lecture I want to give you basic understanding of how regex works - enough knowledge that,
with a little directed sleuthing, you'll be able to make sense of the regex patterns you see others use, and you can build up your practical knowledge of
 how to use regexes to improve your data cleaning. By the end of this lecture, you will understand the basics of regular expressions, how to define patterns
 for matching, how to apply these patterns to strings, and how to use the results of those patterns in data processing.

Finally, a note that in order to best learn regexes you need to write regexes. I encourage you to stop the video at any time and try out new patterns
or syntax you learn at any time.
