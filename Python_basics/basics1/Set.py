#   Set = {} unordered and mutable , but Add/Remove OK. NO duplicates , it is implemnted as hash table so finding is O(1)
#
#
#  Supports powerful operations like:
# union (|)
# intersection (&)
# difference (-)
# symmetric_difference (^)
# These are useful in mathematics, filtering, and data analysis.
