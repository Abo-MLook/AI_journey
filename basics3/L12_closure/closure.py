# A closure is a function that remembers the values from its enclosing lexical scope,
# even if the outer function has finished executing.

#In Python, closures happen when:
# 1- A nested function is defined inside another function.
# 2- The inner function uses variables from the outer function.
# 3- The outer function returns the inner function.
